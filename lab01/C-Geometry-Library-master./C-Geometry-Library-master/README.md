# GeoStruct: A C Geometry Library

Welcome to GeoStruct! This project represents my journey into the world of C programming and geometry. Through this library, I've developed a deeper understanding of C, built a dynamic library, and mastered essential aspects of C programming and build systems.

## Project Overview

GeoStruct is a comprehensive geometry library implemented in C. It provides a set of functions and structures to work with various geometric concepts, such as points, lines, and shapes. This project has allowed me to explore the intricacies of C programming and build a functional and reusable library.

## What I Learned

### Mastering C Programming

Throughout this project, I gained a thorough understanding of C programming. I delved into various aspects, including:

- **Function Creation**: I learned how to define and use functions effectively, including handling function prototypes and function definitions.
- **Dynamic Libraries**: I created a shared library (.so file) to encapsulate my geometry functions and structures, enabling easy integration and reuse in other projects.
- **Build Systems**: I utilized Makefile to automate the build process, managing dependencies and compilation efficiently. This experience enhanced my skills in using build systems and understanding how to compile multiple files into a cohesive library.
- **Handling Multiple Files**: I learned how to organize code across multiple files, improving maintainability and modularity. This included managing header files, source files, and linking them correctly.

## Features

- **Point Operations**: Functions for creating and manipulating points in 2D space.
- **Line Operations**: Functions to work with lines, including intersection calculations.
- **Shape Handling**: Functions for various geometric shapes and their properties.

## Getting Started

To get started with GeoStruct, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GeoStruct.git
   cd GeoStruct
   ```

2. **Build the Library**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. **Include the Library in Your Project**:
   Link against the GeoStruct library by including the relevant header files and linking the .so file in your project.

## Usage

Refer to the `examples` directory for sample code demonstrating how to use the functions provided by the GeoStruct library.
